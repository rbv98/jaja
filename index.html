          <p style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 600; text-align: center;">Thirteen years.</p>
          <p>Somehow it feels like a lifetime, and somehow it feels like it all just began.</p>
          <p>After all this time, I still find myself with nothing specific to say… and yet, everything to say. Every memory, every laugh, every quiet moment, every challenge we have faced together lives in my heart, even when words fall short.</p>
          <p>Our journey has not been perfect—and maybe that is what makes it so real, so beautiful. Through the ups, the downs, the chaos, and the calm, you have stood by me, believed in us, and loved me in ways I do not always know how to repay. Thank you for putting up with me all these years. I am deeply grateful for you, and I promise to keep learning, growing, and becoming better — for you, and for us.</p>
          <p>I truly believe that everything is going to work out just fine, because we are in it together.</p>
          <p>So this is my small gesture — a little corner of the internet made just for us. A place to preserve our story, relive our memories, and keep adding new chapters as we go. Our past, our present, and everything still waiting for us… all in one place.</p>
